# Embedded Software Engineer ‚Äì Coding Prep üöÄ

This repo collects **LeetCode-style problems** and **low-level coding exercises** that are most relevant for **Embedded Software Development interviews**.  

Unlike general SWE prep (which emphasizes graphs, DP, advanced OOP), this guide focuses on **bit-level operations, memory management, and pointer handling** ‚Äî the bread and butter of embedded engineering.
